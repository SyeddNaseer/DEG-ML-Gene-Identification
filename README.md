# DEG-ML-Gene-Identification



This repository contains code for **Differentially Expressed Genes (DEG)** analysis and a machine learning approach to identify crucial genes associated with lung cancer. The project integrates **R** for gene expression analysis and **machine learning** techniques to uncover potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets in lung cancer research.

## Overview

Lung cancer is one of the most prevalent and deadly cancers worldwide. Identifying genes that are differentially expressed in cancerous tissue compared to normal tissue can help discover potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. By combining **DEG analysis** with **machine learning**, this project aims to pinpoint crucial genes that play a significant role in lung cancer progression.

### Key Features
- **Differential Gene Expression Analysis (R-based)**: Identify genes that show significant differences in expression between normal and cancerous lung tissue.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Apply machine learning models to identify the most significant genes for classification and prediction tasks.
- **Gene Prioritization**: Use statistical methods and machine learning to prioritize genes for further validation.

## Repository Structure

- **/data**: Contains the gene expression datasets and metadata used in the analysis.
- **/R-Histroy**: Contains R scripts for DEG analysis, including data pre-processing, normalization, and differential expression calculations.
- **/ML-models**: Python scripts that implement machine learning algorithms for gene selection and model building.

## Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load raw gene expression data.
   - Normalize and clean the data.
   
2. **Differential Expression Analysis (R)**:
   - Use R packages such as `limma` or `DESeq2` to perform DEG analysis.
   - Identify genes with significant expression differences between lung cancer and control samples.

3. **Machine Learning for Gene Selection**:
   - Apply machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) to select the most crucial genes.
   - Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

4. **Feature Scaling & Imputation**:
   - Handle missing data using imputation techniques.
   - Standardize gene expression data for consistent analysis.

5. **Model Training & Evaluation**:
   - Train models using cross-validation to ensure robustness.
   - Identify the genes that are most predictive of cancerous vs. non-cancerous states.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **R** (for DEG analysis): Install the required R packages using the following:
  ```R
  install.packages(c("limma", "DESeq2", "ggplot2"))
  ```

- **Python** (for machine learning): Ensure Python is installed along with the required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
  ```

### Clone the repository

To clone the repository, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SyedNaseer/DEG-ML-Gene-Identification.git
```

## Usage

1. **Run DEG analysis**: Navigate to the `R-scripts` folder and execute the R scripts to perform differential expression analysis.
   ```R
   Rscript DEG_analysis.R
   ```

2. **Run Machine Learning models**: Once DEG analysis is complete, switch to the `ML-models` folder and run the machine learning scripts to identify the most significant genes.
   ```bash
   python gene_selection.py
   ```

3. **Review Results**: Output results, including identified genes and model performance, will be saved in the `results` folder.

## Results

- Lists of differentially expressed genes (DEGs).
- Machine learning-selected genes with high predictive value for lung cancer.
- Performance metrics of the machine learning models.
